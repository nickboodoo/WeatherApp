# WeatherApp

This is a simple application that uses geolocation. 
  Determines the time of day (morning vs night)
  Displayed the current temperature (in both Celsius and Fahrenheit)
  Shows the current weather
  Shows the current location of the user
  
I used the openweather api for the temperature and weather data.
